However, we did find one, which was featured in a paper called \"Modeling wine preferences by data mining from physicochemical properties\", authored by Paulo Cortez, António Cerdeira, Fernando Almeida, Telmo Matos, and José Reis. Their study aimed to model wine quality based on many of the same factors in our dataset. They allowed some degree of error tolerance when computing their accuracy. When they allowed an error tolerance of 0.5, their prediction accuracy for red wine was roughly 60% for the more frequent ratings (5-7) and less than 20% for the less frequent ratings (especially 3 and 4). The prediction accuracy for white wine was marginally better, with an accuracy of roughly 70% for frequent ratings. However, the accuracy for more extreme values (3 and 9) was close to 0%. \n",
